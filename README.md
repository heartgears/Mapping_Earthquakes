## Tasks and Requirements

This project requires a [URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website](https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/feed/v1.0/summary/all_week.geojson) to retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. This data is then added to a map using the JavaScript and the D3.js library. This is done using the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
