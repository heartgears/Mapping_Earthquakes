# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose

The purpose of this project is to visually show the differences between the magnitudes of earthquakes all over the world for the last seven days.

## Tasks and Requirements

This project requires  a URL for GeoJSON earthquake data from the USGS website to retrieve geographical coordinates and the magnitudes of earthquakes for the last seven days. This data is then added to a map using the JavaScript and the D3.js library. This is done using the Leaflet library to plot the data on a Mapbox map through an API request and create interactivity for the earthquake data.
